# A Mini Lesson on Decomposition
*intended for remote students*

### Step One
[Please go through this BBC BiteSize Lesson on decomposition](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zqqfyrd/revision/1)

##### Things to Think About:
* How does decomposition apply to my everyday life?
* How does it apply to a professional programmer?
* When should I use decomposition?

### Step Two
Look at `house.png` and watch `house.mp4`. How would you program this? You need to **decompose** the task and program your own version. Fear not! You don't have to start from scratch. You will be using `functions.py` and `skeleton.py`.

### Step Three
1. Download `functions.py` and `skeleton.py`.
2. **Put these files in the same folder.** Open both in your Python IDE.
3. Review the code in both files. 

`functions.py` has **functions** - portions of code you can reuse by calling the name (like `randColor()`). These functions are used in `skeleton.py` which is **skeleton code** - code where you fill in the blanks. You need to fill in the blanks of `skeleton.py` to make the output look like `house.mp4`.

### Step Four
Complete `skeleton.py` so that the ouput looks like `house.mp4`. You will need to use functions from `functions.py` and you will also need to reference the [Turtle Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) for any Turtle commands. 

### Step Five
When your output looks like `house.mp4`, rename `skeleton.py` as `LastNameHouse.py` with your last name, and submit it to me.
